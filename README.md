# Energy-Use-Extrapolation
I use trees and Random Forest in order to extrapolate on a data set for energy usage in household appliances. Testing of the extrapolation model will be performed 'out-of-sample' on a data set containing appliances with the top 10% highest energy consumption rates. I use both random forest and XGBoosted models in order to extrapolate on the data, and perform a grid search in order to tune to optimal parameters for each model.
The data files used in this exercise are entitled "energy_appliances_standard.csv" and "energy_appliances_extrapolation.csv".
